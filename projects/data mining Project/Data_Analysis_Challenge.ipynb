Our objective is to have at least 50% fill rate for our 20-seats buses and to ensure high customer satisfaction ratings.  \n","\n","\n","You have access to a google sheet that has all the bookings from this year.\n","\n","* Google sheet link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vokpxy5k88m0_rfTKDYZMTxWepQKlkDYG14netFb8zY\n","* Google sheet name: bookings_data\n","\n","The data should be self-explanatory.\n","Not all columns are needed for this challenge.\n","\n","Some important specifications:\n","\n","- date_booking captures when the user books a ride (either directly via the app or indirectly when a support agent or a manager does that for them)\n","- date_ride captures the actual date of the ride\n","- A booking can be canceled (by the user directly or an agent/manager) as long as the day/time of the booked ride didn't happen.\n","- If a booking is not canceled and the user doesn't show up the day/time of the ride, the driver cancels the ride and the `booking_status` will be logged as 'Canceled by driver'\n","- Once a ride is done (user dropped off at destination point), we ask the user to rate the service and the driver via the app\n","- date_joined captures when the user installed the app and created an account\n","\n","\n","\n","## Asks:\n","\n","\n","### Challenge 1: Business Curiosity & Data Insights\n","\n","Conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data further and uncover some insights.\n","Explain what you did and why.\n","Summaries the insights you found.  \n","\n","\n","### Challenge 2: Busline performance (You have to write the query using SQL)\n","\n","As mentioned in the introduction, we care a lot about having a high enough fill-rate of our buses (at least 50%) to ensure that we are profitable.\n","\n","We want to analyse how our current buslines are performing by doing the following:\n","\n","For each line:\n","- We want to find out when it was launched\n","- We will call the week of the launch week_0 (week is from monday to sunday)\n","- Then for each week, we want to calculate the average fill rate during that week\n","\n","The fill rate for a busline on a given day represents the percentage of occupied seats: If for busline X on 15/12/2023, we had 10 passengers, that means the fill rate for that day is 50% (all buses have 20 seats)\n","\n","**IMPORTANT:** All of those metrics have to be calculated using sql in one query\n","\n","The results should be displayed as:\n","- Pivot table with the buslines captured as row, the weeks as columns and the average weekly fill rates as metrics\n","- Choose another visualisation to communicate the resutls\n","\n","\n","### Challenge 3: Conclusions and perspectives\n","\n","Summarise in 5 sentences what you've learned from the data and what you think we should explore and focus on next, and why.  \n","\n","\n","## What is expected from you:\n","\n","- Copy this colab, add your first name to the title\n","- All your work should be contained in your notebook\n","- Once done, share your notebook with me ahmed@enakl.com (view access)\n","\n","## What you will be evaluated on:\n","\n","- Understanding of what the data captures\n","- Communicating your thoughts and results clearly\n","- Writing clear clean code\n","- Your business understanding\n","- Your analytical thinking\n","- Your python and sql skills"],"metadata":{"id":"jk-UJ2Tx42uq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"qW9JPGzG4ybp"}}]}
